## Project Description
This project aims to demostrate the influence of the news and searches of a brand and the fluctuation of its prices on the stock market. For the analysis I have chosen Nike and Adidas as an example.

## Questions & Hypotheses
With this analysis I would like to answer the main question of the project: Is the mention of the company's name affecting to the stock prices?

## Dataset
I have used different datasets from Google Trends and Investing depending on the period of time and the brand.

## Workflow
- Choose project topic
- Questions about topic
- Plan project
- Data cleaning (most of the time!)
- Visualizations of the data
- Paper and presentation

## Organization
I have used a Trello Board to organize the project and follow the progress through the week.

The repository is composed of three jupyter notebook files, one for each brand (Nike and Adidas) and the other one the information in common.
